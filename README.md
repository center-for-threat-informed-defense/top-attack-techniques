Top ATT&CK Techniques provides defenders with a systematic approach to prioritizing
MITRE ATT&CK® techniques. Our methodology considers technique prevalence, common
attack choke points, and actionability to enable defenders to focus on the ATT&CK
techniques that are most relevant to their organization.
